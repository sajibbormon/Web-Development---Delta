/**
 * Node REPL
 ------------
 .help gives us commands

 REPL -> Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop

 If we type 'node' in the terminal then it will open REPL just like console in browser.

We can not manipulate DOM using Node bcz it runs on browser.

It is only a js runtime environment.

If we try to access window object which is object of the browser, we cann't access this.

There is a equivalent object of node.js which is similar like window object.

'global' object is the equivalent object.
