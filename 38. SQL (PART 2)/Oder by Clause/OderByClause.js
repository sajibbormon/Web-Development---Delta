/**
 * Order By Clause
--------------------
To sort in ascending (ASC) or descending order (DESC)

Syntax:
SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name
ORDER BY col_name(s) ASC;

If we want to sort based on a column in ascending or descending order we use ORDER BY Clause.

Suppose we want to Show data in ascending order based on Age column. 

SELECT Name, Age, Email FROM user
ORDER BY (Age)ASC;
