/**
 * DELETE Table
------------------
Delete (to delete existing rows)

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


Suppose deleting a user whose name is donald.

DELETE FROM user
WHERE Name = "donald";

We must use WHERE bcz without using WHERE it will delete all users data.

To delete  specific rows data we can use DELETE.
