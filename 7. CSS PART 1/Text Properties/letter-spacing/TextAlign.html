    <h1>I am Iron Man</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
        Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed 
        by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense 
        #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. 
        Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, 
        alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, 
        have been published consistently since the character's creation.

    <h2>Publication History</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Premiere</h3>
    <p>
        Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer 
        who runs the weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. When Stark was captured in a war 
        zone and sustained a severe heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and escaped his captors. 
        Iron Man's suits of armor grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other 
        abilities. The character was created in response to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt to create 
        a likeable pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been used to explore political themes, 
        with early Iron Man stories being set in the Cold War. The character's role as a weapons manufacturer 
        proved controversial, and Marvel moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s.

    <h3>Solo series</h3>
    <p>
        Pepper Potts is a Stark Industries employee who Stark promoted to his executive assistant.[174] 
        The original portrayal of the character was that of a simple love interest and damsel in distress.[114] 
        She came to manage the business herself, as Stark had little interest in his responsibilities.

    <h2>Characterization</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Fictional character biography</h3>
    <p>
        Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born in Long Island, New York. As a child, he inherited his family's 
        business, Stark Industries when his parents were killed in a car crash.[89] Developing equipment for 
        the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. 
        His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands 
        Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man.[18][9] 
        The war zone Stark visited was changed retroactively multiple times by different writers to correspond with the 
        character's age, which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in which the timing of significant events 
        in the world of Marvel may change.
