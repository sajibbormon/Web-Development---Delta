/*
The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.

The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.


    路 static

    路 relative

    路 absolute

    路 fixed


    Positon - Static
    ----------------
    The top, right, bottom, left and z-index properties have no effect. 
    This is the default value. By default if any an element position is not set/given then it is static.

    Position - Relative
    -------------------
    the offset is relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.

    Position - Absolute
    -------------------
    The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page
    layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor(which is not static), if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block.

    Absolute means: We consider the position based on total document.


    Position - Fixed
    ----------------
    The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
    It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport.
    for fixed if the position(top, left, right, bottom) is not given then there is will no space for that element.
