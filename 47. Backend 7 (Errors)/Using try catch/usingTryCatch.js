/** 
 Using Try Catch
-------------------------

In this application  there could be mainly two error \

1) id ---> doesn't exists
2) validation ----> doesn't match the requirements of database

and other errors could occur.
But we want our server keep running without crashing. To achieve this, we will try catch block
