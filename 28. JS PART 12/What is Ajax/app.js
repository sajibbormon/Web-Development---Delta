Ajax
-----
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

Sending request for data from API and getting response process is asynchronous process.

Do the job without reloading the page.

AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a set of web development techniques that allows 
web applications to send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display
and behavior of the existing page. This means that parts of a web page can be updated without requiring a 
full page reload, leading to a more dynamic and responsive user experience.


Examples of applications using AJAX:
Google Maps: Dynamically loading map tiles and points of interest as the user navigates.
Gmail: Loading new emails and updating the inbox without a full page refresh.
Social media feeds: Continuously loading new content as the user scrolls.
