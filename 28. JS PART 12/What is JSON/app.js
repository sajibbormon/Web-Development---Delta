/*

JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight, text-based format for data interchange. 
It's designed to be both human-readable and easy for machines to parse and generate, making it a popular choice
for transferring data, particularly between a server and a web application. JSON is language-independent, 
meaning it can be used with various programming languages and platforms. 


Data Structures:
JSON primarily uses two structured types: objects and arrays. 

Objects: An object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where keys are always strings, and values
    can be various data types like strings, numbers, booleans, other objects, or arrays. 

Arrays: An array is an ordered collection of values, also of various data types, enclosed in square brackets. 

Example: 
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 30,
      "city": "New York",
      "isStudent": false,
      "courses": [
        "Math",
        "Physics",
        "History"
,
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "zip": "10001"
      }
    }
